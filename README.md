# Console-Connect-Four
This console game was created during my education at Software University. It is a simple version of "Connect Four" game.

If you want to play with friends something fun, this game is suitable. The players can be more than two and everyone can choose what name will have and with what sign will play.

You win the game when you have four consecutive positions with your sign in one of directions - 4 in column, 4 in row or 4 in some of diagonals in the field.

If no one win the game and the field has no empty spaces, the game is over.
